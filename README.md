# Credit Check

This is a starter repo for Credit Check, a Turing School Back End Mod 1 project described in more detail [here](http://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/credit_check).

> Using the Luhn algorithm to base my methods from, I created a terminal-run tool
that will check whether a credit card number given to it is valid or invalid. Then
the user is given the option to check a new number or exit the tool. If an invalid
input is given, the tool will exit automatically.
